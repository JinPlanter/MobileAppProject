# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## Navigation Strategy



## Context
- Since the app we will be making is simple in Nature, not much is required in terms of Navigation. We need to take careful consideration when making these design choices to ensure a streamlined User Experience. 

## Decision
We have decided that the app's navigation will consist of:

- A small header at the top of the app. 
	- App and user settings will be located in the header.
- Navigation tabs under the header (or maybe on the sidebar?).
	- Each tab will contain a main app feature, such as:
	- Add expense, calendar view, graph view and more.

## Rationale
- This layout will allow users to intuitively interact with the app.  

## Consequences
- idk
