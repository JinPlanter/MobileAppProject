# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## Hardware

### Context

- blah blah blah group project blah blah blah

### Decision

- After some deliberation, we have decided that the only hardware features we need is touch screen functionality and local storage. The touch screen is for the user to interact with our application, while the local storage is to hold all the user information. There is no need for speakers, a fingerprint scanner or other hardware features.

<br/>

### Rationale

- what do you MEEEEEEAN tbh

- Simplicity I guess, its not super duper complicated yo

<br/>

### Consequences

- Our app isnt the flashiest in the world, its not going to know when and where you make every purchase, so its up to the user to be responsible and use the app properly.
